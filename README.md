# PriceIsRight
Created in my senior year of high-school, I coded a Java project alongside my colleague Julia Baum, I created various mini-games featured in the Price Is Right CBS gameshow. I created PNGs for the gameshow assets in Adobe Photoshop. Mini-games featured in the application include: Push-Over!, the Big Wheel, and the Final Showcase Showdown.
